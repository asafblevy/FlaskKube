Asaf Bein Levy DevOps project for Kovrr

# Usage guidelines:

Please clone the repository into your machine.

Install Kubernetes and helm to run the project.

You should build the image using the Dockerfile in the project directory, from there on
simply install the helm chart and the project should be good to go.

to access the pods from your local machine please port forward the flaskee service using-
kubectl port-forward service/flaskee 8080:8080, from there on you can use curl with the 8080
port to access health checks, prometheus metrics and so on.

To use Git CI just push to the master branch.

To get this project done I used a lot of different sources online, mainly StackOverflow.
other github projects for reference and also some web articles.

# Challenges:

I did run into problems using the main script, I had to change the IP at the bottom to listen
to all IP's and not just the local IP for the script to be able to listen from the kube master.

I also did not manage to finish flask tests in time, currently the tests would work if the 
main script stopped running to get the tests done.
